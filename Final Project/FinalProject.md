# Final Project


## Team

Jonathan Tan - jmt362

## Project Plan

### Big Idea

A robot which converts your indoor potted plant into a house pet.
Features such as water monitoring, sunlight chasing and additional pet-like features.

### Timeline

Sketch Designs 11/20

Begin wizarding/prototyping 11/25

Complete 3D printing of assembly 11/30

Debugging sofware 12/3

Preparing demo video 12/5

### Parts Needed

- 2 Servo Motors (one for each wheel)
- Solar Panal or Light detector
- Adafruit Mini Display (Plant's face)
- 2 Tires or geared wheels (3D Printed)
- Raspberry Pi
- Battery

### Risks/Contingencies

Different Plants prefer different amount of sunlight and water, it might be hard to personalize. 


### Fall-back Plan

Paper model of Roosevelt island/Cornell Tech with smart features (weather, transportation, night lights etc.)

Reducing features of the plant robot (to be named)


Here is a picture of our idea:

Here is what we are going to present in the class:

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 15

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 17

Functional check-off - November 29 & December 1

Final Project Presentations - December 6

Write-up and documentation due - December 12

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing, and test the interaction with people. 

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.


## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
