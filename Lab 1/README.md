# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you that read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_
## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

# Week1:  
## Part A. Plan 

__Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here__


I decided to use the idea of a visual thermometer, which can inform users of outdoor temperature through light changing instead of asking users to check the text of whether a report is on their cellphones. This design allows users to check the outdoor temperature by looking at our device. The users of this visual thermometer can also customize the indicated colors through their cellphone app.

__Include pictures of your storyboards here__

![This is an image](https://github.com/Peggypei98/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Scenario1.jpg)

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

__Summarize feedback you got here__


1. How to know the rage of the temperature?
2. People still have to check the weather on their phone to know more infromation. 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

__Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?__


The things that seemed better on paper that acted out were that I could find many drawbacks in my previous paperwork and try to improve it. For instance, I initially used my cellphone as the indicator, which was a little bit too heavy to keep on windows. Thus, I would put the weight of the device as a consideration in my following study. 

__Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?__


The new ideas that occurred to me from the actions are that I can try to make my device connect to all the 3C devices in the space. Furthermore, I can also put other thermo measurment into my design, such as shower water and fridge. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*


For me, Tinkerbelle is really cool. Yet, there are some inferences between the corntorlled devices and reacted devices when lots of people using the same wifi in a room. If we can add a pair process to make sure the interaction is paired between selected devices, this problem might be solved. 


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

__Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.__

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

__Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.＿＿
![This is an image](https://github.com/Peggypei98/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/paper%20prototype.jpg)

__What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?__


My concern is that the lights in the daytime might not be as visible as during nighttime since the sun is much brighter than a screen. This result might be a little bit inconvenient for users to see the signal at a long distance. Also, sometimes the lights might not be responsive due to a weak WiFi signal or are overloaded with too many devices. Thus, I will change the background color to a darker one or add lights to make my device more visible during the daytime.   


## Part F. Record

__Take a video of your prototyped interaction.__
[![Watch the video](https://github.com/Peggypei98/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-29%20at%209.38.49%20PM.png)](https://youtube.com/shorts/zGPIVeON4Oc?feature=share)


\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 




# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

__Summarize feedback from your partners here.__
1. I really love the storyboards - Nice use of color and super clear. I also appreciate the simplicity of the design because it makes it easy to understand. I wonder what the interaction with the phone to set colors would look like and why the default colors range from purple to red instead of blue to red. 
I'd also love to know more about the costume you designed and why it is a pouch with the device instead of something more integrated. Great job!
Michael Joseph Kelleher , Aug 30 at 9:48am

2. In this video, the device displayed a color which matched the current temperature after the user asking about the weather.
This idea is good and I like the feature that users can customize color setting on their own electronic devices. I consider the device can add some sound/vibration features to tell users detailed weather information, so users don’t need to look up the weather on their phone again.
Tsung-Yin Hsieh , Sep 1 at 6:21am

3. Very nice illustrations, Peggy! The idea is very interesting and it can have many possibilities in delivering weather information. However, please keep in mind that the requirement of this lab is 7 storyboard + 3 sketches + 3 videos. Your documentations are also very thorough! For the next part of this lab, maybe you can dig this idea deeper and consider the following questions: in what shape and what form does it take, how can you prototype it to be more similar to what you want, and how can people interact with it. Overall, nice work!


## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

__Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)__


# Week2:
## Part A. Plan 

__Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here__

More and more people suffer from poor eyesight or retina damage due to overusing 3C devices daily at a young age. Overexposed to harmful "Blue Light" and High-Energy Visible (HEV) light is the main reason for these eye-damaged related problems. The interactive device I would like to propose here is a tiny accessory that can detect the amount of environmentally harmful light and send a cellphone reminder to users while they are overexposed to blue light or HEV. 

For example, the accessory and myself are involved in this interaction. I can wear a detector accessory while using a computer; the accessory will automatically detect the amount of blue light and HEV exposure in the environment. If I overexpose myself to harmful light, I will receive a notification from my cellphone that informs me to wear blue light-blocking glasses or turn on the eye protection mode on my laptop. Another scenario is happening in the living room. The accessory and my family are included in this interaction. More specifically, when watching TV, the accessory can keep us from overusing our eyes and overexposing to harmful light by sending us a cellphone reminder.

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

__Summarize feedback you got here__


1. How did the device connect to the cellphone? How is the device-device pair process? 
2. Does the device need to be charged?

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

__Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?__


The things that seemed better on paper than acted out were that I could find many drawbacks in my previous paperwork and try to improve it. For instance, while acting out the whole process, I discovered that the notification process was not that necessary. If I could make the entire process automatic, users won't be interrupted by the reminders while they are busy doing something.

__Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?__


The new ideas that occurred to me from the actions are that I can try to make my device connect to all the 3C devices in the space. Furthermore, I can also make the entire process automatic. 


### Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device.

__What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?__


My concern is that the look should be attractive and fashionable since it is designed to be an accessory. Moreover, it is a daily wearing thing, so I need to put more emphasis on the material and weight of the accessory. 
Last but not least, sometimes the accessory might not be responsive due to a weak WiFi signal or is overloaded with too many devices.    


## Part F. Record

__Take a video of your prototyped interaction.__
